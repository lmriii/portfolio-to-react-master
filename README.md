This is taking the previous portfolio site made with React and giving it a whole new look. Doing tihs I was able to really appreciate how powerful React is and how easy it is to play around with your components once they are built. Also learned that it is best to code any additions to your 'base' component so that when you're re-arranging all that is needed is to swap out components with minimal code added.

This is a portfolio site for a photographer. In it's initial stages it has the following components: Home, Gallery, About and Contact.

The project will keep evolving as I keep learning more. Next stages are to turn all Class components into functional components as well as the implementation of Typescript.
